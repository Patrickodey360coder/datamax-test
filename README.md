## DATAMAX CRUD TEST USING LARAVEL AND REACT 

# How to use
- Clone project
- Open terminal
- install node modules
- configure .env file, generate key
- create database
- perform migrations
- start laravel server "php artisan serve"
- start client side "npm run watch"
- to test API, use POSTMAN

## NOTE ONE
- To fetch data from database to the frontend, replace the 'api1' with api2 in the Books componenet.
- When you switch to api2, you have to change the json response to 'data' instead of 'data.data'
- Also change numberOfPages to number_of_pages when using api2
